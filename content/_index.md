Hi! 

Iâ€™m Harshvardhan Vatsa, a pre-final year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/). My academic journey revolves around the fascinating realms of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Generative AI, where I am deeply involved in research and exploration.

In addition to my research endeavors, I have a strong background in full stack development with expertise in JavaScript and Python. My technical skills enable me to design and implement robust solutions across various platforms.

Do check out my [projects!](/projects)

In my free time you will find me either doing music production or endlessly configuring my Arch Linux and Neovim.
You can find all of my configs on my [Github](https://github.com/hrsvrn).

Thank you for visiting!
